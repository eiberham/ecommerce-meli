# E-commerce

This is a module that leveraging the mercadolibre's api allows you to search products currently on sale in the platform and get relevant information from them like description, price, among others.

It has a backend designed with express.js whose responsibility is to reach the mercadolibre's api and return what we want, to enhance the overall performance it does caching with redis and clustering via pm2 module.
